    /// Get relative humidity readings across Singapore.

    ///
    /// These data are collected from automated weather instruments, and is automatically published as soon as it is generated. There could be instances when there are gaps in the data due to technical problems. The data is subject to correction subsequently if necessary.

    /// ## Usage
    /// Use the `@Singapore` property wrapper to access the relative humidity data.
    ///
    /// You can use a Switch statement to handle the different states of the data:
    /// - `.none`: The data has not been loaded yet.
    /// - `.loading`: The data is currently being loaded.
    /// - `.failure`: The data failed to load.
    /// - `.success`: The data has been successfully loaded.
    ///
    /// Using the success parameter, you can access the data and display it in your SwiftUI view.
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// struct RelativeHumidityView: View {
    ///
    ///     @Singapore(\.relativeHumidity) var relativeHumidity
    ///
    ///     var body: some View {
    ///         switch relativeHumidity {
